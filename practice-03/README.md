## js-03 (Calculator, Capitol letters & Average of scores)

This file is about the third JavaScript exercise, which consists of three parts.

At first, you will be asked which part you need. Calculator, capital letters or average of scores?

The first part is for performing mathematical calculations on two numbers, using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operators.

The second part is for changing words and sentences from lowercase to uppercase.

The third part is for calculating the final score or the average of five grades of a student.

I used search and chat GBT to do this exercise so that I could code more than my knowledge.
