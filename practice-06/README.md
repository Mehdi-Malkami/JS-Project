## js-06 (add, remove or edit an object in array)

This folder is for the sixth JavaScript exercise, which is about adding, deleting and editing objects in an array.

At first, you will be asked if you want to do something about one of the add, remove or edit items.

In the first part, a function is designed to add a new object to the array.

In the second part, I wrote simple codes to delete an object. Just take the object number from the user under the index title to delete the desired object.

In the last section, a simple code is written to edit the name of one of the people. Of course, this part can be expanded.

I took help from JBT Chat for this exercise.
